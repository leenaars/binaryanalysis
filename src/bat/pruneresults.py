'''
This program can be used to optionally prune results of a scan. Sometimes
results of scans can get very large, for example a scan of a Linux kernel image
could have thousands of string matches, which can each be found in a few
hundred kernel source code archives.

By pruning results the amount of noise can be much reduced.

To remove a version A from the set of versions the following conditions have
to hold:

* there is a minimum amount of results available (20 or 30 seems a good cut off value)

* all strings/variables/function names found in A are found in the most promising
version

* the amount of strings/variables/function names found in A are significantly
smaller than the amount in the most promising version (expressed as a maximum
percentage)
